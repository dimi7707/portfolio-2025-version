      description: "At Inchcape Delivery Center, I played a key role in building and consolidating the digital development team in the Colombia office for the company’s Ecommerce division. I took on the role of Frontend Technical Lead, supporting the growth and strengthening of the area from its early stages. Together with my team, we went through a knowledge transfer process with the development team in the Philippines, which allowed us to gain deep expertise in different digital products and evolve into a fully self-sufficient local team, capable of handling end-to-end projects, providing specialized technical support, and developing or expanding the company’s product offerings.

      During my time at the company, I worked closely with the team on the development, maintenance, and improvement of various widgets integrated into the websites of several automotive brands. These widgets played a crucial role in supporting the entire vehicle sales, purchase, and maintenance flow, serving as key tools to enhance user experience and streamline business processes within Inchcape’s digital ecosystem.

      As a technical lead, beyond contributing directly to development, I focused on setting clear guidelines for the team, promoting best practices, quality standards, and an emphasis on scalability and maintainability. I encouraged code reviews, defined frontend architecture guidelines, automated deployment processes, and strengthened a culture of continuous learning. My leadership aimed to empower the team to make informed technical decisions and ensure the delivery of high-impact, high-quality products."
